# Machine Learning project branch structure
### visualization part:
- master branch: add tsne and acc-loss curves
### model part:
- resnet branch: resnet model in pytorch without pretrain
- my_model_1 branch: first model version designed by ksc999
- my_model_2 branch: second model version designed by ksc999
### loss function part:
- try_pytorch_loss branch: MSELoss in pytorch
- triplet_loss branch: TripletLoss designed by ksc999
- center_loss branch: CenterLoss designed by ksc999
- cosface_loss brach: CosfaceLoss from other contributors in github
### add and eliminate noise part:
- noise branch: add noise, both from source and during training; use dynamic threhold method designed by ksc999 to alleviate bad influence by noise from dataset
